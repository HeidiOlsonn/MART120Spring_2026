In the last lecture, what affected me the most was the idea that culture is not just something you’re born into, but something you build through your everyday experiences and routines. The speaker talked about how culture is shaped by the environments you’re in and the people you’re surrounded by, which made me think about how my own culture has changed as I’ve moved through different stages of my life.
I really identified with the message that culture can be personal and constantly evolving. Growing up in a small town and now being in college, I’ve realized how much place and community influence the way you think and express yourself. Culture isn’t just traditions or background. It’s the habits, values, and connections that become part of who you are over time.
The lecture made me think more intentionally about how culture shows up in my daily life. It helped me see culture as something active and continues to grow as I do.
