<H6>Little Red Riding Hood tells the story of a young girl who is sent by her mother to bring food to her sick grandmother. On her way through the woods, she meets a wolf who tricks her into revealing where she is going. The wolf rushes to the grandmother’s house, eats the grandmother, and disguises himself in her clothes. When Little Red Riding Hood arrives, she notices that something seems strange before realizing it is the wolf. In many versions, a woodsman arrives to save her and her grandmother, teaching a lesson about the dangers of trusting strangers.</H6>
